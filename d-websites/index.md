# IPFS & Unstoppable D-Websites

For a **decentralized website** \(d-website\) or **decentralized application** \(DApp\), you will upload website files to IPFS network instead of to Github or other centralized file hosting service. [**InterPlanetary File System** \(IPFS\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.

IPFS allows users to not only receive but host content in a similar manner to BitTorrent. As opposed to a centrally located server, IPFS is built around a decentralized system of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing. Your decentralized website will have a unique hash or **content identifier** (CID), allowing other peers in the network to find and request that content from any node that has it using a **distributed hash table** \(DHT\).

Once you have attached this IPFS hash to your domain, you can navigate to your new d-website using a human-readable address much like a centralized website resolved through DNS. Currently, native support for Unstoppable Domain resolution and IPFS is limited, but extensions are available for Firefox and Chromium-based browsers.
