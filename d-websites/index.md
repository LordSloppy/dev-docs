# IPFS & Unstoppable D-Websites

For a decentralized website \(d-website\) or decentralized application \(DApp\), you will upload website files to IPFS network instead of to Github or other centralized file hosting service. [InterPlanetary File System \(IPFS\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.

IPFS allows users to not only receive but host content, in a similar manner to BitTorrent. As opposed to a centrally located server, IPFS is built around a decentralized system of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing. Your decentralized website will have a unique hash, allowing other peers in the network to find and request that content from any node who has it using a distributed hash table \(DHT\).

You can also view the IPFS Youtube Video below for a quick overview of building a decentralized website and attaching the IPFS hash to your Unstoppable Domain.
