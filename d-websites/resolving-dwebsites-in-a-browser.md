# Resolving Unstoppable D-Websites in a Browser

It will take some time for the IPFS website transaction to resolve on the blockchain after the transaction is signed with the userâ€™s wallet. After the domain records are updated, the decentralized website will resolve in certain browsers and browser extensions.

## Compatible Browsers and Extensions

The following is a list of compatible browsers and extensions for Unstoppable d-websites:

* [Opera](https://unstoppabledomains.com/opera) for desktop and mobile (supports .crypto)
* [Brave](https://unstoppabledomains.com/brave\_pa) for desktop and mobile (supports .crypto)
* [Google Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unstoppable-extension/beelkklmblgdljamcmoffgfbdddfpnnl?hl=en-US\&authuser=0) (supports all Unstoppable Top Level Domains)
* [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unstoppable-extension/) (supports all Unstoppable Top Level Domains)
* [Unstoppable Browser](https://unstoppabledomains.com/browser) (supports .crypto and .zil)

## Add a Custom DNS to Your Browser

:::info
These settings only allow your to resolve .crypto domains in your browser. To resolve .zil or other top level domains, you will either need the [browser extension](https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension) or the [Unstoppable Browser](https://unstoppabledomains.com/browser).

Once you have configured your browser according to this section, you will be able to access .crypto Unstoppable domains in two different ways:

1. `http://domainname.crypto`. note that it is `http` and **not** `https`
2. `domainname.crypto/`, using a **forward slash** to override your browser's default search engine behavior.

:::info
If you have the Unstoppable extension in your browser you will need to disable it to switch to DNS over https (which retains the domain name in the browser).

## Resolve Using a Gateway URL

You can also resolve a decentralized website using a gateway URL, such as the ones provided by [Blockscan](http://blockscan.com) or [Pinata](https://docs.pinata.cloud/gateways/dedicated-gateways).&#x20;

IPFS gateways provide workarounds for applications that do not yet support IPFS natively, which allows those browsers and tools to access IPFS content. See the resource guide on [IPFS Gateways](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#overview) for more information.

## **Redirect to a Traditional DNS Record with an Unstoppable Domain**

In order to set up a redirection to a traditional domain, you will need to do a redirection via index.html on your blockchain domain so users are sent to a traditional domain.&#x20;

1. On your computer, open a text editor (for example: Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for Mac) and paste the following code into an empty file.

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>HTML Meta Tag</title>
    <meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "1; url = YOUR WEBSITE URL HERE" />
    </head>
    <body>
    <p>YOUR WEBSITE DESCRIPTION HERE </p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. Replace `YOUR WEBSITE HERE` with your website URL and `YOUR WEBSITE DESCRIPTION HERE` with a short description of your website and save the file as `index.html` (**do not use any other name**).

3. Open `index.html` from your hard drive to see if everything is working before proceeding. Right-click the file and select "**Open with**" followed by your browser of choice.

    ![Right click to 'Open With' a specific or preferred browser](../images/open-with-specific-browser.png)

3. Follow steps 2 and 3 of [Connecting a D-Website to Your Domain](connecting-a-dwebsite.md) to upload your redirect `index.html` to IPFS and attach it to your domain.
