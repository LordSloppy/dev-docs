# Stripe Payments Guide

Unstoppable Domains supports [Stripe](https://stripe.com) payments. Stripe is a payment provider that allows you to accept credit cards, PayPal, and Apple Pay from customers. This is a recommended and secure payment method for partners that mostly use client-side applications.

The following diagram shows the general process between Stripe and Unstoppable Domains after a customer buys a domain.

## Step 1: Create a Stripe Account

You need to have a Stripe account before connecting it to your Unstoppable Domains Partner account. If you have not created a Stripe account before now, create one here: <https://dashboard.stripe.com/register>.

## Step 2: Connect Stripe to Unstoppable Domains

Click on the `CONNECT` button in the Stripe section of the [UD Partner dashboard](https://unstoppabledomains.com/resellers). Unstoppable Domains uses different Stripe API keys for live and test orders.

Your Stripe API keys are public keys and they are safe to reveal in your application:

* pk\_test\_\* (reseller-test-\* namespace)
* pk\_live\_\* (all other domains)

:::info
The `Stripe Live Connect Button` is how you get paid by Unstoppable Domains when your customers make a purchase; it uses real money and generates real transactions. The `Stripe Test Connect Button` does not involve real money and uses test credentials to integrate.
:::

After clicking the Stripe Live or Stripe Test `CONNECT` button, Stripe will walk you through the integration form:

Once your Stripe and Unstoppable Domains accounts have been connected, your Stripe API key will appear directly in your Stripe dashboard.

## Step 3: Retrieve Your Reseller ID and Secret API Token

<embed src="/snippets/_reseller-id-location.md" />

## Step 4: Prepare Your Authorization Headers

<embed src="/snippets/_auth-headers-preparation.md" />

## Step 5: Prepare Your Request Body

The request body contains information about your order and must be in JSON format for the API. Hereâ€™s the structure:

```javascript
{
  "payment": {
    "method": "stripe"
  },
  "domains": [
    {
      "name": string, // domain name you are minting
      "ownerAddress": string, // wallet address to mint the domain to
      "email": string, // UD email address to link the domain to
      "resolution": object // predefined records to mint the domain with
    }
  ]
}
```

* `payment`: A key-value dictionary with payment information about the order:
    * `method`: (string) The payment method the API should create. For Stripe payments, the value should be `"stripe"`.
* `domains`: (array) An array with information about the domains you want to purchase:
    * `name`: The domain name you want to purchase. This parameter is required for every order.
    * `ownerAddress`: The wallet address the domain should be minted to. This parameter is optional.
    * `email`: The email address the domain should be linked to after purchase. The user can mint the domain from their UD dashboard later. This parameter is optional.
    * `resolution`: A key-value pair of resolution records to configure for the domain after minting. See the Records Reference guide for supported key values. This parameter is optional and requires the `ownerAddress` parameter to be provided.

:::info
You need to provide either the `ownerAddress` or `email` parameter in every order request. You can also provide both parameters in your request.
:::

## Step 6: Use the Orders Endpoint

<embed src="/snippets/_orders-endpoint-usage.md" />

## Step 7: Retrieve the Stripe Payment Intent ID

Under the hood, Unstoppable Domains uses Stripe's [Payment Intents API](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents) to process Stripe payments and generates a `Payment Intent ID` for the partner to complete the payment. The `Buy a Domain or Claim Free Domain` endpoint response follows this format:

```json
{
    "orderNumber": "ORDER_NUMBER",
    "total": 500,
    "payment": {
        "method": "stripe",
        "details": {
          "clientSecret": "STRIPE_CLIENT_SECRET",
          "paymentIntentId": "STRIPE_PAYMENT_INTENT_ID"
        }
    },
    "items": []
}
```

The value of the `clientSecret` and `paymentIntentId` fields can be used with the Stripe [Payment Intents](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents) API to complete the payment.

## Stripe Payment Example

Here is an example request to purchase a domain with the following details using the Stripe payment method:

## Receive Stripe Payouts

Stripe payouts occur daily directly from Stripe and can be tracked within the Partner dashboard by clicking on the `View Test Dashboard` or `View Live Dashboard` button, depending on which payouts are being tracked.
