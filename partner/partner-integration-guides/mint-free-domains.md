title: Free Domain Minting Guide | Unstoppable Domains Developer Portal
description: This guide shows how to mint free domains with your Partner account.
---

## Overview

Unstoppable Domains offers free domain minting to Partners based on specified criteria. Authorized Partners can use the following [API endpoints](../partner-api-endpoints.md): `Get Free Domains Suggestions`, `Reserve Domain Name`, and `Claim Free Domain`.

The following diagram shows the general process between the Partner and Unstoppable Domains during the free domain minting process.

## Step 1: Retrieve Your Reseller ID and Secret API Token

## Step 2: Setup Criteria for Free Domains

Partners work with the Unstoppable Domains team to establish the "allowed free TLDs" and "allowed free tiers" criteria for their account.

Then, the "allowed free TLDs" and "allowed free tiers" list is assigned to the Partner's account, and they can only mint a free domain if it matches the tier and has an appropriate domain ending.

The table below shows how the pricing tiers are structured at Unstoppable Domains. Most free domains will be a Tier 7 or Tier 8 domain with a combination of letters and numbers.

:::info
Domains containing numerals in the name (i.e: tim1, monica95, etc) are discounted by up to 75% of the standard prices, and most free domains fall within this category.

## Step 3: Prepare Your Authorization Headers

<embed src="/snippets/_auth-headers-preparation.md" />

## Step 4: Prepare Your Order Security

Unstoppable Domains uses [Fingerprint](https://fingerprint.com/) to verify free domain orders and catch sophisticated fraudsters. See the [Fingerprint Docs](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs) for integration guides and how to generate a Fingerprint Visitor ID for your users.

:::info
The Unstoppable Domains Partner API will only accept a `Visitor ID` generated within the past 30 seconds and has a confidence score of at least 90%.
:::

### Generate a Fingerprint Public Key

Unstoppable Domains provided an API endpoint to fetch Fingerprint public keys, which are needed for generating the `Visitor ID`. Send a `POST` request with the authorization headers you have prepared to the `Get Fingerprint Public Key` endpoint. Here is the URL for our API environments:

Sandbox Environment:

```
POST https://api.ud-sandbox.com/api/v2/resellers/{{ PARTNER_RESELLERID }}/security/fingerprintjs/keys
```

Production Environment:

```
POST https://unstoppabledomains.com/api/v2/resellers/{{ PARTNER_RESELLERID }}/security/fingerprintjs/keys
```

:::info
The `PARTNER_RESELLERID` path parameter is the same one you retrieved from your partner account earlier.
:::

:::info
The endpoint returns a different key when called to avoid rate limitations. Also, the generated Fingerprint `Visitor ID` will always be the same despite the different public keys being returned.
:::

### Integrate the Fingerprint Subdomain

Unstoppable Domains has a dedicated subdomain for Fingerprint verification to improve integration and user identification. You need to set the `endpoint` property in your Fingerprint initialization to our subdomain.

Sandbox Environment:

```
https://fp.ud-sandbox.com
```

Production Environment:

```
https://fp.unstoppabledomains.com
```

Here's a sample code snippet:

```javascript
// Initialize the agent at application startup.
const fpPromise = import('https://fpcdn.io/v3/your-public-api-key')
  .then(FingerprintJS => FingerprintJS.load({
    endpoint: 'https://fp.unstoppabledomains.com'
  }));
```

### Tag Your Fingerprint Request

Unstoppable Domains requires you to [tag your requests](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/quick-start-guide#tagging-your-requests) with the `linkedId` property and your `ResellerID` when generating the `Visitor ID` for your users. Here's a sample code snippet:

```javascript
// Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
fpPromise
  .then(fp => fp.get({linkedId: '{{ PARTNER_RESELLERID }}'}))
  .then(result => console.log(result.visitorId));
```

The code snippet below shows how to completely integrate Fingerprint verification into your free domain flow:

```javascript
<script>
  // Initialize the agent at application startup.
  const fpPromise = import('https://fpcdn.io/v3/your-public-api-key')
    .then(FingerprintJS => FingerprintJS.load({
      endpoint: 'https://fp.unstoppabledomains.com'
    }));

  // Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
  fpPromise
    .then(fp => fp.get({linkedId: '{{ PARTNER_RESELLERID }}'}))
    .then(result => console.log(result.visitorId));
</script>
```

:::info
The `your-public-api-key` placeholder in the code snippet above should be replaced with the public key gotten from the `Get Fingerprint Public Key` endpoint.
:::

## Step 5: Prepare Request Body

The request body contains information about your order and must be in JSON format for the API. Hereâ€™s the structure:

```javascript
{
  "payment": {
    "method": "free"
  },
  "security": [
    {
      "type": "fingerprintjs",
      "identifier": string // Fingerprint Visitor ID of the user minting the domain
    }
  ],
  "domains": [
    {
      "name": string, // domain name you are minting
      "ownerAddress": string, // wallet address to mint the domain to
      "email": string, // UD email address to link the domain to
      "resolution": object, // predefined records to mint the domain with
      "resellerIdentityKey": string // domain reservation ID
    }
  ]
}
```

* `payment`: A key-value dictionary with payment information about the order:
    * `method`: (string) The payment method the API should create. The value should be `"free"` for free domains.
* `security`: (array) An array with information about the order security:
    * `type`: The order security method. The value should be `"fingerprintjs"` for Fingerprint verification.
    * `identifier`: The Fingerprint Visitor ID of the user minting the domain.
* `domains`: (array) An array with information about the domains you want to purchase:
    * `name`: The domain name you want to purchase. This parameter is required for every order.
    * `ownerAddress`: The wallet address the domain should be minted to. This parameter is optional.
    * `email`: The email address the domain should be linked to after purchase. The user can mint the domain from their UD dashboard later. This parameter is optional.
    * `resolution`: A key-value pair of resolution records to configure for the domain after minting. See the Records Reference guide for supported key values. This parameter is optional and requires the `ownerAddress` parameter to be provided.
    * `resellerIdentityKey`: The domain reservation ID. This parameter is required if you reserved the domain before minting.

:::info
You need to provide either the `ownerAddress` or `email` parameter in every order request. You can also provide both parameters in your request.
:::

## Step 6: Use the Orders Endpoint

:::success congratulations!
You have successfully minted a free domain with the Partner API.

## Considerations

The following considerations apply to minting free domains:

* The Reseller ID will be allowed to provide specified domain endings for free.
* If the Reseller ID doesn't have an allowance to provide free domains, then they will not be permitted to mint free domains.
* The domain is available for sale (e.g., it's not restricted, protected, trademarked, claimed, etc.)
* The domain does not have a custom price set.
* It has 8+ characters, at least one letter, and one number.
* If a wallet or email already has a free domain, then a second free domain is not permitted.
* The Fingerprint Visitor ID provided must be generated within the past 30 seconds and have a confidence score of at least 90%.
