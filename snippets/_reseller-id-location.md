To access your `ResellerID` and `Secret API Token`, you must navigate to your [Sandbox](https://www.ud-sandbox.com/partner-api-dashboard) or [Production](https://unstoppabledomains.com/partner-api-dashboard) Partner dashboard. The `ResellerID` is used to identify the requests as coming from a Partner, while the `Secret API Token` is used for authentication to ensure that only authorized Partners can access the API.
