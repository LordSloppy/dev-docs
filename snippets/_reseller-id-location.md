Navigate to the partner dashboard to retrieve your `ResellerID` and `Secret API Token`. The API uses the `ResellerID` to identify partner requests, and the `Secret API Token` is required for authentication when minting free domains.

Reseller accounts in the [sandbox environment](/partner/set-up-sandbox-for-testing.md) automatically receive a `Secret API Token` and do not require additional verification from Unstoppable Domains.
