Unstoppable Domains periodically adds new domain endings, and our Resolution libraries and APIs are designed to automatically detect and support them. Therefore, there is no need to implement a front-end filter in your application (e.g., by hard-coding specific domains or using a regex filter for just .crypto, .nft, etc.). We also provide an [API endpoint to query for supported domain endings](/developer-toolkit/resolution-integration-methods/resolution-service/endpoints/get-supported-tlds.md).
