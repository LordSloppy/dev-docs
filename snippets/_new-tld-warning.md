:::warning Important
Unstoppable Domains periodically releases new domain endings, and our Resolution libraries and APIs will automatically detect and support any new domain endings. It is imperative for future proofing your resolution integration to allow all domain inputs to pass through rather than implementing a front end filter (e.g. avoid hard coding domains or placing a regex filter for just .crypto, .nft, etc.).
