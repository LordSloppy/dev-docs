# L1 (Ethereum) vs L2 (Polygon) Comparison

#### Table. High Level Differences between L1 and L2

| L1 (Ethereum)                                                                                | L2 (Polygon)                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ethereum blockchain network                                                                  | Polygon blockchain network, but based on Ethereum and uses the same Ethereum addresses, so many smart-contract features will continue to function |
| PoW (Proof-of-Work) consensus                                                                | PoS (Proof-of-Stake) consensus                                                                                                                    |
| Transactions are handled individually so gas fees must be paid on each and every transaction | Transactions are handled in bulk, which greatly reduces gas fees, so UD can cover fees for customers                                              |
| Customer covers gas fees for minting and managing domains                                    | UD covers gas fees for minting and managing domains                                                                                               |
| Domain features will still be available but may not receive new feature updates              | Domains will have access to the newest feature updates                                                                                            |

## Faster Transactions

Rather than sending every transaction through Layer 1 for a lengthy and expensive minting process, L2 works to bulk process these transactions on a separate blockchain to help with congestion issues. This results in much faster transactions with regards to processing time.

## Reduced Gas Fees

Layer 2 (Polygon) uses a PoS consensus that is a more economical solution than the PoW alternative used on Layer 1 (Ethereum), which greatly reduces transaction and gas fees. Unstoppable Domains will cover the L2 transaction fees for customers who manage their domains using our website.

## Easier Domain Management&#x20;

Domain management will be much cheaper and faster compared to L1, due to lower fees and faster transactions. This allows customers to make more frequent updates to domain records, such as NFT galleries and IPFS websites, due to benefits of the L2 infrastructure.
