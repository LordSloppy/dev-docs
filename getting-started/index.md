title: Quick Start
description: The UD developer portal is both an educational and a technical resource. We hope it will be equally useful for both technical and non-technical readers.

This developer portal is designed to help you understand how to build and integrate custom applications using Unstoppable Domains products.
It's a great companion to our [Feature Guide Collection](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkKiQerk3s0AbMvBafwmJdR8pv7qPYeL-) on Youtube.

Also, you might explore our growing list of [Integrated Applications](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps) to draw inspiration for your own project.

## Before You Begin

You'll need the following to get started:
- Basic understanding of smart contracts [link here]
- Some knowledge of differences between L1 and L2 network [link here]
- A free test domain [link here]
- A stable test environment

## How This Portal is Organized

These items are listed in order of complexity. For example, if you are just starting out with crypto and blockchains, you may want to begin with the use cases and domain registry essentials. More advanced users may decide to jump right to the developer toolkit or integration guides.
