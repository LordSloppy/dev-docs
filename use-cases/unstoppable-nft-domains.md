# What are Unstoppable Domains?

Unstoppable Domains are NFTs, and they are decentralized. This makes them, in a word, unstoppable. Once a user claims a domain to a wallet, they have absolute control over that domain.

# What makes NFT domains decentralized?

NFT Domains can be transferred, updated, and linked to other services without any involvement from Unstoppable Domains. Unstoppable Domains cannot deactivate, change, or transfer a domain's records without a user's permission.
