## What are Unstoppable Domains?

Unstoppable Domains are NFTs, and they are decentralized. This makes them, in a word, unstoppable. Once a user claims a domain to a wallet, they have absolute control over that domain.

## What makes NFT domains decentralized?

NFT Domains can be transferred, updated, and linked to other services without any involvement from Unstoppable Domains. Unstoppable Domains cannot deactivate, change, or transfer a domain's records without a user's permission.

## How can I learn more?

To learn more about how Unstoppable Domains work under the hood, see the [CNS Architecture](../getting-started/domain-registry-essentials/cns-architecture-overview.md) and [CNS Smart Contracts](../developer-toolkit/smart-contracts/cns-smart-contracts.md) or [UNS Architecture](../getting-started/domain-registry-essentials/uns-architecture-overview.md) along with [UNS Smart Contracts](../developer-toolkit/smart-contracts/uns-smart-contracts.md).
