# Supporting Unstoppable Domains in My Web Browser

This page outlines the use case for supporting Unstoppable Domains in my web browser, which allows users of your browser to create and view decentralized websites. 

## How does it work?

The website is decentralized by being created on the Ethereum blockchain, and the domain is stored in a userâ€™s wallet, just like a cryptocurrency. 

# Who controls the content? 

Individuals control their own content and identity with a decentralized website. This means that no one can delete content (such as blogs, podcasts, artwork, social media) or move it around other than the domain owner. 

# Are there any working integrations for this?

# How can I get started? 

See the guides on [Resolving Domains in Web Applications](../developer-toolkit/resolve-domains-in-web-applications.md) and [Browser Resolution Algorithm](../developer-toolkit/resolve-domains-browser/browser-resolution-algorithm.md). For a list of test domains, see [Browser Resolution Test Domains](../developer-toolkit/resolve-domains-browser/test-domains.md).
