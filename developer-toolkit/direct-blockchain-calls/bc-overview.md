# Resolve Domains with Direct Blockchain Calls

Blockchain domain names are domain names launched as smart contracts on public blockchains. What sets them apart from traditional domain names (like `.com`) is that blockchain domains are stored by their owners in their wallet like cryptocurrency, and no third party can change or remove them.

One strategy for resolving domains is to read directly from the blockchain. This is a secure method of resolving domains, but this method requires manual updates and modifications as it is not maintained by UD like the [Resolution Libraries](../resolution-libraries/libraries-overview.md) or [Resolution CLI](../resolution-cli.md).

## **Use Cases**

* [Resolve Unstoppable Domains with Direct Blockchain Calls](resolve-unstoppable-domain-names.md)
* [Resolve .zil with Direct Blockchain Calls](resolve-zil-without-libraries.md)
* [Resolve Domains with Ethereum Smart Contracts](resolve-eth-smart-contracts.md)
