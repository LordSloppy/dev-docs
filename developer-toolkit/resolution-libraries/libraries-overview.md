# Resolution Libraries

Resolution libraries are used for interacting with blockchain domain names. They can be used to retrieve [payment addresses](../crypto-payments.md), IPFS hashes for [decentralized websites](../../build-a-decentralized-website/overview-of-ipfs-and-d-web.md), DNS records and other [records types](../../domain-registry-essentials/records-reference.md). Each Resolution Library is built and maintained by Unstoppable Domains, so updates happen automatically.

## Supported Domains for Resolution Libraries

The Resolution Libraries support decentralized domains across two main zones:

| Name Service                   | Supported Domains                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Unstoppable Name Service (UNS) | `.crypto`, `.nft`, `.blockchain`, `.bitcoin`, `.coin`, `.wallet,` `.888`, `.dao`, `.x` |
