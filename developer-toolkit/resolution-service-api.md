title: Resolution Service API
description: This page covers the resolution service API feature for Unstoppable domains hosted by Alchemy.
---

Resolution service provides an API for getting domain data and metadata regardless of that domain's location, whether it is stored on Ethereum, Zilliqa, Polygon, or any other blockchain. The service is used to cache blockchain events in a database for easy retrieval without accessing blockchain APIs.

## Alchemy Hosted API

We have partnered with Alchemy to offer UD developers an Alchemy-hosted Resolution Service API. Developers will [sign-up for Alchemy's API service](https://auth.alchemyapi.io/signup?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.alchemyapi.io%2Fsignup%2F%3Freferrer\_origin%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) and retrieve API keys directly from Alchemy.

For Alchemy API documentation, endpoints, and support videos, visit Alchemy's dedicated page for [Unstoppable Domains APIs](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/enhanced-apis/unstoppable-domains-apis).
