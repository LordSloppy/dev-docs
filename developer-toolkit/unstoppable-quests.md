# Unstoppable Domains Quests

## Context üìö

> *"If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together"*

We're up to our ears in exciting work at Unstoppable Domains, and even then, there are millions of things that never get checked off our to-do list. We know we can't do it alone and that's why we created "Quest" for developers like yourself can complete and continue building towards our vision of the [Decentralized Web](https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/the-growth-of-the-internet-and-the-web).

This is our first iteration of Quests, and we will continue improving it over time. Right now, we have a list of Quests ‚Äî which will evolve overtime as quests are completed and more continue to get added based on various needs. The goal is to foster innovative solutions to tricky problems that we're tackling.

**Interested in applying for an existing Quest, or have a suggestion for another (we're always considering new ones)? Have any questions?**

## Integrations üîå

Domains need integrations in order to actually be used by customers. At Unstoppable, we work alongside companies and apps in order to offer domain resolution natively in the app. However, we can't get to them all ‚Äî so we're asking for the community's help in integrating Unstoppable Domains into other applications

Integration quests will cover open-source crypto wallets (for payments), browsers (for website resolution), and other apps. 

<details>
<summary>Instructions</summary>

1. Initiate a pull request from the open-source app's GitHub repo to modify the source code *(links provided in the table below).*
2. Modify the source code to integrate with the Unstoppable resolution libraries: 
    * [Resolution](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution)
    * [Resolution-Java](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-java)
    * [Resolution-Swift](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-swift)
    * [Resolution-Go](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-go)

3. Documentation for resolution libraries is available here
    * For wallets: [Resolution Libraries Overview](./resolution-libraries/)
    * For browsers: [Resolving Domains in a Web Applications](/developer-toolkit/resolve-domains-in-web-applications.md)
    
4. Inform us before you make the commit. We will setup a code review and confirm that everything is working correctly. After the code review, you can proceed with the commit to the repo.
5. The quest is completed when the PR is merged into the git repository!

## Website Templates üï∏Ô∏è

A common question we get from owners of domains is how they can make decentralized websites and resolve these sites with their domains. While we have built templates, there is a lot of room for improvement.

<details>
<summary>Instructions</summary>
    
DM us on Discord or Twitter if you have ideas on how to improve our templates. You can build another from scratch, or you can fork our templates.

See our [IPFS Websites](/d-websites/) guides for information on [Connecting a D-Website to Your Domain](/d-websites/connecting-a-dwebsite.md) and [submitting new templates](/d-websites/using-a-template/#build--share-your-own-template) to our d-web respository.

## Chainlink üñáÔ∏è

Currently, we have [immutable verification of your Twitter with an Unstoppable Domain](https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/verifying-twitter-on-your-domain-with-chainlink).

Now, we're introducing a bounty for a new Chainlink verification for your Unstoppable Domain. It can be GitHub, Gmail, Instagram, etc.

Ask on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/b6ZVxSZ9Hn) or DM [@mvwi](https://twitter.com/mvwi) on Twitter, if you're interested

<summary>Instructions for Impression Mining</summary>
    
We're offering <strong>$1 in domain credits per 10 impressions on Twitter</strong>.

Impression mining allows anyone to become a micro-influencer for Unstoppable Domains! 

**EXAMPLE:**¬†ddwchen.crypto brings receipts from 11 tweets about Unstoppable Domain or its products from July 2021 totaling 240k impressions; she is rewarded with $2.4k worth of domain credits.

Participants will simply snap a screenshot of their impression counts and submit to the intake form for a monthly payment in domain credits. Judging submissions is at the sole discretion of Unstoppable Domains. The reviewers reserve the right to cap a payment or deem an account ineligible for current or future rewards.

**The program will *not* tolerate/reward:**

- Spamming followers
- Paid impressions
- General trickery
- Inauthentic content
- Misleading content
- Saturation of themes

**Notes:**

- Unless you have built up an audience beforehand, consistent success with this program will not generally come swiftly
- In general, content should aim to be:
    - Shareable
    - Aesthetically pleasing
    - Distribution-minded
    - Uniquely Insightful (Use-Case, how-to, history, stat/metric, story, testimonial, infographic, video)
    - NOT about speculation, price, nor the selling of domains
