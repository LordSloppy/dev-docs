## Resolution Service API

For our Alchemy-hosted web API that allows you to quickly build applications that fetch UD domain data from the blockchain with a single API request, see the [Resolution Service API](/developer-toolkit/resolution-integration-methods/resolution-service/overview.md). The Unstoppable Domains team manages this service.

## Resolution Libraries

For language-specific, blockchain-agnostic libraries for resolving Unstoppable NFT domains (including domains on Ethereum, Polygon, and Zilliqa) see our [Resolution Libraries](/developer-toolkit/resolution-integration-methods/resolution-libraries/libraries-overview.md) guide. These are managed by Unstoppable and updated regularly to reflect changes in our services.

## Resolution CLI

For an Unstoppable-managed, blockchain-agnostic command-line interface for resolving all Unstoppable NFT domains, see the [Resolution CLI](/developer-toolkit/resolution-integration-methods/resolution-cli.md) guide.

## Resolve With Direct Blockchain Calls

For developers who want more direct, low-level control over domain resolution, see the [Resolve With Direct Blockchain Calls](/developer-toolkit/resolution-integration-methods/direct-blockchain-calls/bc-overview.md) guide. This will require updates to any integration to reflect future changes in Unstoppable resolution services, such as new domain endings.

## Resolve Using Matic.js SDK

For developers interacting with the Matic network using the [Matic.js SDK](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic.js) and who want an easy way to integrate domain resolution functionalities into their applications, see the [Resolve Using Matic.js SDK](/developer-toolkit/resolution-integration-methods/resolution-libraries/resolve-with-maticjs.md) guide.
