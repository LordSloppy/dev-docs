## Overview

The resolution libraries are the easiest way to integrate domain resolution into your applications. They directly communicate with the Ethereum, Polygon, and Zilliqa blockchains to retrieve domain records, so you do not have to.

Resolution libraries interact with blockchain domain names and are used to retrieve [payment addresses](index.md), IPFS hashes for [decentralized websites](../d-websites/), DNS records, and other records types. Each Resolution Library is built and maintained by Unstoppable Domains, so they are always up-to-date.
