## Step 1: Get Your Client Credentials

To begin the integration process for Login with Unstoppable, you will need to obtain and configure your client credentials using the **My Clients** and **Client Configuration** pages. Please see the [**Login Client Configuration**](../login-integration-guides/login-client-configuration.md) guide for more details.

When you've customized your client and saved your changes, you will need the **Client Metadata** to configure your integration. This can be copied directly from the first section of the **Client Configuration** page.

```javascript
{
    clientID: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    redirectUri: "http://localhost",
    scope: "openid wallet email:optional humanity_check:optional"
}
```
