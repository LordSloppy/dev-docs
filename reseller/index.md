## Step 2: Submit a Reseller Application

* After logging in, you will have the option to submit a reseller application. Please complete the required information and submit the application. The review process takes up to five business days but is usually sooner.

* After your application is approved, you will be given full access to the reseller dashboard to view your ResellerID and update payment information.

To avoid missing the email about your reseller application status, please update your email settings to approve messages from [notifications@unstoppabledomains.com](mailto:notifications@unstoppabledomains.com), so it doesn’t end up in your spam folder.

## Step 3: Configure Payment Information

* The Reseller API must be configured with one or more payment options before users can begin purchasing domains. Please follow the instructions in the **[Reseller Integration Pathways Guide](reseller-integration-guides/reseller-pathways.md)** to integrate one or more payment methods for your reseller account.
